## Saptha Swaras

Swara means ‘to sound’. It is a musical note, there are 7 swaras called as the Saptha Swaras.

| Sa           | Sadjam         | 
| Ri           | Rishabam       | 
| Ga           | Gandharam      | 
| Ma           | Madhyamam      | 
| Pa           | Panchamam      | 
| Da           | Daivatham      | 
| Ni           | Nishadam       | 

When sung in perfect pitch and frequency, the have a transformatory effect on the singer, listener and the eco-system as well.

The first swara **Sa** - Sadjam means, ‘sad’ - six and ‘jam' - giving birth to. So, Sadjam means the one that gives birth to the next 6 swaras. It is said so because the tonic note **Sa** is not fixed, it depends on the convenience of the performer. Meaning, if the performer is singing at **G**, **Sa** becomes **G** and the **Ri, Ga, Ma…** adjusts and follows according to that **Sa**. Similarly, if the performer is singing at **F#**, **Sa** becomes **F#** and the **Ri, Ga, Ma…** adjusts and follows according to that **Sa**. 

The Saptha swaras have been said to be derived from the sounds of birds and animals. They are also associated with the seven chakras of the human body and also with the seven colors.

| Swara        | Animal / Bird      | Chakra        | Colors        |
|:-------------|:-------------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| Sa           | Peacock            | Mooladara     | Red           |
| Ri           | Bull               | Swadistana    | Orange        |
| Ga           | Goat               | Manipura      | Yellow        |
| Ma           | Crouncha bird      | Anahata       | Green         |
| Pa           | CooCoo             | Visuddhi      | Blue          |
| Da           | Horse              | Agya          | Indigo        |

**Shadjam** – Since the Swara is sounded from 6 positions such as nose, neck, heart, inner tongue, teeth and lips, the swara is named as Shadjam. Since this swara is also the cause of producing other six swaras R G M P D N, it is named so. Mythologically , Shadjam swara resembles the cry of  a Peacock. This swara devathā was first seen by Agni.

**Rishabham** – The air/vāyu that rises up from the Nabhi, touches the neck and the head and produces the sound that resembles that of a bull’s bellowing. Hence the swara is named as Rishabham (the Sanskrit name for bull- Lord Siva’s vehicle).  This note captivates the heart of the listener and is said to originate from the heart. This swara devathā was first seen by Brahma.

**Gāndharam** – The air/vāyu that rises up from the abdomen/ Nābhi, touches Hridayam and Kantam, three strategic positions, and hence the name Gāndharam. This swara is the important note for Gāndharva Vidya and represents the word in the form of Gāna or Sangeetham, and hence termed as Gāndharam. Mythologically the swara resembles the bleating of goat. This swara devathā was first seen by Chandra/Moon.

**Madhyamam** – The air/vāyu that rises up from the abdomen/ Nābhi touches the heart and shines in the middle portion. The swara is centrally located between the other swaras G R S on the lower frequency and P D N on the higher frequency (SRG-M-PDN).  Hence, aptly named as Madhyama swara. The swara resembles the Call of Heron. This swara devathā was first seen by Vishnu.

**Panchamam** – The air/vāyu that rises up from the abdomen/ Nābhi touches Hridayam, Kantam, Sirassu (head) and Oshtam (lips). Since the swara touches the five strategic positions including the Nabhi, the swara is named as Panchamam. The swara resembles the Call of Cuckoo. This swara devathā was first seen by Nārada.

**Dhaivatham** – The air/vāyu that rises up from the Nabhi touches Hridayam, Kantam, Sirassu (head), Tālu (inner tongue) and Dantha (teeth). Since the swara touches the six strategic positions including the Nabhi, the swara is named as Dhaivatam. The name also means worshipable. The swara resembles the neighing of the horse.  This swara devathā was first seen by Thumburu.

**Nishādam** – Since the Saptak ends with this swara, the name Nishāda. The swara resembles the trumpet of elephant. This swara devathā was first seen by Thumburu

The readers may wonder, these swaras are just a form of sound or nāda and how flowers, ornaments, janma naksthra, weekday etc are assigned to them. Modern researchers may criticize this concept. It shows the mindset that if we do not understand a concept, that concept is wrong. Experts who have learned this Sāstra in accordance with lakshya and lakshana, from the Great Gurus who were nadōpāsakas, according to strict upāsana krama and bhakthi, will definitely be able to understand the divine subtlety. Subtlety cannot be seen, it should be felt within oneself.

| Ri           | Hridayam/Heart         | Chembakam     | Pāyasam        | Lion          |
