## Mayamalavagowla Raaga

---

15th melakarta raaga.

Mayamalavagowla is the 3rd raga. This auspicious raga evokes shaanta (peace) rasa and pathos. It creates a soothing effect. Suitable to sing at all times, particularly, the first prātaḥ-sandhyā-kālaṃ (dawn). It is commonly used for beginners lessons such as Sarali Varisais, etc. Since it eschews vivadi swaras (relatively discordant notes), has a uniform distance between svara sthānas (relative position of notes) and has symmetry, they are easier to learn. It is an ancient raaga and has been around for a long time.
