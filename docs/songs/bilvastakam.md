    <strong>
        Tridalam triguNaakaaram trinetram cha triyaayudham
        <br>
        trijanma paapasamhaaram eka Bilvam shivaarpaNam
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    <em>
        I offer the bilva patra to Shiva. This leaf embodies the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. This leaf is like the three eyes, and the sun, moon and fire. It is like three weapons. It is the destroyer of sins committed in three earlier births. I perform pooja for Shiva with the bilva patra.
    </em>
